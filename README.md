Zero Two (ゼロツー, Zero Tsū) is the main heroine and deuteragonist of DARLING in the FRANXX. She is a human-klaxo sapien hybrid and a member of the APE Special Forces, primarily fighting on the front lines. As an elite Parasite with the codename "002", also known as the "Partner Killer", Zero Two had always accepted solitude due to her horns and Klaxosaur blood. Despite having no regard for human life or her own and being accustomed to fighting solo, she took interest in Hiro and offered an opportunity to pilot with her, making him her new partner and "darling". After Hiro was able to ride with her more than three times, the pair became the 13th Plantation's newest members, piloting the powerful FRANXX Strelizia.
Over time, Zero Two developed romantic feelings towards Hiro. However, her animalistic determination to become fully human, along with Hiro's apparent fear of her increasing feral characteristics resulted in the couple briefly drifting apart. When their relationship as partners began to take a turn and slowly crumble, they realized their forgotten memories of their meeting during childhood. The two chose to sacrifice their lives in order to safeguard and ensure the survival of humankind.

A thousand years later, Hiro and Zero Two's souls reincarnate as a pair of children that meet each other again and rekindle their romance.



Appearance
As a child, Zero Two looked much more like a monster, with red skin, long sharp nails, and fanged teeth. While her eye colour was the same, her sclera was red instead of white. Her horns were also much larger in comparison to her head, and her hair was a lighter shade of pink. In terms of clothes, all she was given was a dark grey cloak and white wrappings from Hiro that substituted for shoes.

Zero Two appearance
Zero Two's appearance.

Growing up, Zero Two developed a fair complexion. She had a slender and athletic figure; she was the tallest girl in the squad and even taller than most of the boys as well. She had waist-length, long pink hair with straight bangs covering her forehead and a pair of red horns on her head and a white limiter headband over her horns. She had sharp, turquoise eyes with rings around the pupils and pinkish-red markings on the canthi.

Zero Two's full ensemble was composed of a white military cap with matching overcoat and boots. She was often seen wearing her signature red military uniform, black leggings, and white boots. Zero Two's originally wore the 9's pistil suit: a red bodysuit with white accents. After being assigned to Squad 13, she adopted the squad's standard Pistil uniform: a white bodysuit with red accents.

As side effects of aggressively riding Strelizia, Zero Two's fangs and horns can grow at an alarming rate. Her eyes shine red when angered, even while wearing her limiter headband. It once got to the point when her face was deathly pale and her eyes blood red. Her horns could also branch out to the point of being able to touch the ceiling, and her skin color could also revert back to her original red color.

In Episode 17, Zero Two was given a flower headband by Miku, which was worn for the rest of the episode.

In Episode 21, Zero Two removes her limiter in order to save Hiro, which causes her skin to turn red similarly to her as a child, and her horns to grow and stretch across the room similarly to tree branches.

Zero Two Strelizia True Apus
Zero Two - Strelizia True Apus.

In Episode 23, Zero Two merged with her FRANXX and transformed into Strelizia's True Apus form. In this form, its faceplate was replaced by Zero Two's face, in which she appeared with more pronounced lips and pinkish lip color. She had a white helmet with red lines with a blue horn-like weapon on top of it. There was also a veil-like sheet of light behind Apus' helm. Strelizia True Apus' legs changed into a semblance of a white, shoulder-less, and bare-back dress with green accents. In one of the MATO comics, Strelizia True Apus is considered to be Zero Two's wedding dress.





Personality
Since childhood, Zero Two had been alone due to her Klaxosaur blood, always being seen as a "monster". The way people treated her as a child made her lose faith in people which is especially seen when she was a child: being very defensive or aggressive when people tried to interact with her. Besides that, Zero Two acted like a wild animal or a feral child, eating with her hands, growling, making other vocal noises instead of speaking and chasing after mice that were near her. However, Zero Two was also shown to a fairly cheerful, curious, and happy girl, and it was during her time with Hiro that shaped much of her personality and quirks in the present, such as her sweet tooth, the way she referred to herself as ("Boku"), and the nickname she had for Hiro, "Darling". Because Hiro treated her as he would anyone else, whereas others didn't treat her as a human for one reason or another, Zero Two developed a deep admiration and liking towards him. Despite having her memories of the darling from her childhood erased, Zero Two retained some fragmented memories which was why she strived to become human no matter what.[1]

As she grew up, Zero Two's personality was rumored to be dangerous, cold, and alluring. She was an elite pilot with the pseudonym "Partner Killer", given the mysterious cases of her co-pilots dying after only three sorties FRANXX rides. However, she appeared to be playful towards Hiro and sometimes showed humor; which is evident during their first meeting, in which she teased him and called him a "pervert". However, she prioritized her duty as a Parasite more than anything, not because she wanted to protect Papa and the others, but because she wanted to "become human". Her outlook on life was quite cynical which is why she didn't bother with a name since they were all meant to fight and die. She had also been a prized military asset of APE and sent to fight on the front lines for so long that she had no regard for human life or her own since they all would become a statistic when they died anyway. When people around her died, she hardly batted an eye at it because, to her, it was just a fact of life that everyone dies. Zero Two always kept people at arm's length with mocking humor, nihilism, and emotional detachment. Zero Two also freely talked about how much she hated their society. However, after seeing Hiro's determination to pilot with her, Zero Two noted that they were very similar and she invited him to partner up with her, despite having fought alone during the majority of her life and never leaning on others for support.[2]

Zero Two's sweet tooth, and smug and rebellious attitude.

It is later seen that Zero Two was a very unruly, passionate, fierce-tempered, self-confident, smug, assertive, and carefree girl who hated to follow the rules set up by the adults. She was very outspoken and honest, and unlike the other Parasites, she did not care about Papa and held no respect for him and the other Sages, only seeing them as people who lied to her throughout her childhood. Her seemingly care-free rule-breaking helped break Hiro out of his crippling depression and blind adherence to rules, and the cheerful affection she showed him inspired some of the other Squad 13 Parasites to be more affectionate with each other. Zero Two's behavior was also quite childlike, as evidenced by when she wiped her hands on Zorome's uniform. Zero Two also demonstrated impressive agility, performing somersaults and flips then landing on her feet every time. During the Girls vs Boy feud, Zero Two tricked the girls into believing she would cooperate with them, after which she tricked the boys into walking in on the girls while they were bathing, then proceeding to steal both the boys' and the girls' clothes. While being chased by Hiro, she teased him and laughed while running throughout the house. By doing that, she felt just a little more like a human.[3] While an exceptionally gifted parasite, Zero Two also had extremely odd quirks: being a sloppy eater who uses her hands, often licking people, such as herself, though she didn't like how she tasted; Hiro, who tastes like danger; Ichigo, who tastes sweet; and Ikuno, who tastes like a secret. She also often mused about how she wanted to go in the ocean, dousing her food in honey, and having no sense of personal space.

It was also implied that she knew more about the outside world than the other members of Squad 13. She also appeared to be more knowledgeable about different things than the others, as she knew what a "kiss" was, what came "after kissing" and the meaning behind "love". She also urged the Parasites to speak up for themselves and do what they think is right before they regret it and before "it's too late".[4][3] Zero Two also clearly didn't mind whether she's wearing clothes or not, judging how she didn't even bat an eye about Hiro seeing her naked and instead picked on him for holding her panties.[2]

However, soon after, Zero Two became more obsessed than ever to become human and to reunite with her original darling. She became more melancholic and silent, barely speaking or showing any affection to Hiro, despite her behavior in previous episodes. When Hiro would ask her to talk to him about her problems because he wanted them to understand each other, Zero Two coldly rejected him and she stated that they could understand each other well enough by piloting Strelizia. Her obsession later caused her to become violent towards Squad 13, including Hiro the more he tried to calm her down. While fighting Klaxosaurs, Zero Two acted recklessly, disregarding Ichigo's orders and plans, and getting irritated by Hiro getting in her way. Zero Two became much more aggressive both to Hiro and while battling Klaxosaurs, chasing the Klaxosaurs until she was away from the group and then repeatedly stabbing a Klaxosaur corpse she had just killed, maddeningly saying she will kill more Klaxosaurs. When Zero Two started getting a little too obsessed with killing Klaxosaurs during a mission in which Hiro tried to rein her in. However, in the heat of the moment, she ended up choking him and said things that were heard by the others that heavily imply she was going to kill him like so many of her other co-pilots in the past.

Zero Two enraged
Zero Two questioning the concept "humanity" after being vilified for not being "human" by Ichigo.

Zero Two also seemed to only care about herself, so much so that even when Hiro was dying, it seemed like she couldn't be brought to care when Ichigo demanded she takes it easy on him. That having been said, she had deep insecurities about not being human. Though she hates it when other people bring up the fact she's not human and when people call her a monster, she can be very self-deprecating about it herself and even calls herself one. Additionally, her hatred for Klaxosaurs stems from the fear of becoming one herself. Her desire to avoid this, however, caused her to act more monstrous. This problem escalated when she developed a hatred towards mirrors, as she was seen crushing the hand mirror that Hiro had gifted her in frustration, and proceeded to smash every single mirror throughout the boarding house, possibly due to them reflecting her more monstrous appearance.[5] It only gets worse later on, where she came to consider herself a monster not for what she was, but for the horrible things she had done. Zero Two did also not appreciate "friendship" and never took it seriously because she was convinced that Squad 13 would never accept her, so she didn't even bother trying to be nice to them or show consideration for their lives. Zero Two didn't display any concern for the lives of any pilot besides Hiro, because she thought of them the same she thinks of herself: they are all meant to live and die fighting Klaxosaurs. However, it is clearer in the following episodes that she really had come to care about the other Parasites in Squad 13 and felt guilty for betraying their trust but stubbornly willed herself to keep displaying no empathy for them and to outwardly insist that she never considered them true friends, just temporary allies.

However, after she realized that Hiro was indeed her darling from her childhood, Zero Two felt extremely apologetic and distraught about her actions. With Ichigo fed up with Zero Two's antics, however, she forcefully disallowed her and Hiro to even visit. Ichigo even proposed to Nana that unless Zero Two were to be kicked out from Squad 13, they would not cooperate at the upcoming mission, much to Zero Two’s disbelief and frustration. Later, Goro was finally able to convince Ichigo to let Zero Two visit her darling. However, when the squad arrived at Hiro's hospital room, he was not there. Hiro’s sudden disappearance enraged Zero Two; she felt deceived and proceeded to beat up the members of Squad 13, mainly Ichigo. When Hiro came back and unintentionally called Zero Two "a monster", Zero Two finally broke down, leading to her deportation.[6] Later when Hiro finally reunited with her, Zero Two was afraid of being touched and seen by him, because she considered herself a monster and didn't think she deserved forgiveness after what she had done. However, after Hiro fully forgave her, apologized for calling her a monster, and promised her that they would talk out their problems and always be together, they confessed their love for each other and became an official couple. After this incident and officially being accepted by Squad 13, Zero Two admitted that she finally understood what "being human" really meant; living together with other humans, helping each other while also being true to their feelings. Thanks to this discovery, Zero Two's personality reverted back to her former personality, becoming much more friendly, responsible, cheerful, and composed. She also accepted herself, as she could happily look at herself and her horns in the mirror.[7] Despite that, she was concerned when Hiro turned into part-Klaxosaur like herself, stating that she wanted him to remain human.[8] Zero Two was able to acknowledge her mistakes which is why she was determined to do everything right, especially in regards to her friends. She also felt guilty over her past actions and started having nightmares over the stamens she had consumed.[9]

Zero Two regained her curious and carefree nature, doing things in her own pace and stating that she was interested in traveling the world like the Princess in her book.[10] She also retained her playful personality as she was visibly seen to be sassy and energetic, not afraid to get what she wanted to without putting up a friendly fight. She began to exhibit a fascination with the extent of a human’s capabilities, as she remarked humans were wonderful at being able to leave a mark for the future via reproduction, something her body was incapable of doing. Furthermore, she became more open to her fellow comrades in Squad 13, openly socializing with them and enjoying their company, as she teaches them how to fish, encourages them to learn to cook for themselves, and helps plan Kokoro and Mitsuru’s wedding. She became very protective of Squad 13 and encouraged them to explore their true feelings and taught them concepts only available to the outside world. She also felt extreme anger towards those who interfere with the squad’s personal lives, as she was visibly dismayed at Papa and the others for destroying Squad 13's brief period of happiness and erased Kokoro and Mitsuru’s memories due to their decision to get married.

Zero Two's devotion
Zero Two's devotion to save Hiro.

Her relationship with Hiro became much better and Zero Two came to cherish and love him more than anything, to which she finally understood Hiro's words where he wanted them to understand each other. The two had shown unconditional love for one another and knew that their bond could overcome whatever obstacle fate threw at them. Zero Two was seen to be a very determined girl, as well as very devoted to Hiro, going great lengths for him on the cost of her own safety, and even mentioning that she didn't care about anything as long as he was with her. Zero Two also became closer to everyone in Squad 13, which is particularly seen how protective she became of them, when she became ecstatic upon seeing them coming to her aide during the fight against VIRM, and how worried she was when Ichigo and Goro fought off a VIRM soldier. As much as she loved Hiro and her ultimate dream in life was to be with him forever, she was burdened with the knowledge that him ingesting her blood from when they were children was gradually turning his body into that of a klaxosaur, and she casted all the blame for this on herself to the point she was willing to make whatever sacrifice was necessary to prevent him from losing his humanity. She decided to risk her life to protect the lives of Hiro and others by going off to space and fighting VIRM alone, but she also rationalized with Hiro that she deliberately separated herself from him because she couldn’t live with herself if he became a klaxosaur as long as he remained with her. Additionally, Zero Two became emotionally prepared for the strong possibility that she and Hiro would have to part ways in the grounds that they are different creatures and the dystopian society they lived in would never allow them to be together. However, when Hiro proved his resolve to stay with her no matter what so they can see the outside world together and create their own destiny, she gave in and accepted his vow to never let her go. When she and Hiro went off to space to fight VIRM's home planet, Zero Two was moved to tears by her friends' words in that they would always wait for them to return. Because of this, Zero Two’s perspective on humans changed drastically; she concluded humans are strong beings for their perseverance and ability to leave behind a mark for the future, and fight for what they believe was the right cause. Right before her demise, Zero Two and Hiro were completely willing to sacrifice themselves to save the Earth and so their friends and all the other people could live a good life. They state that even if they would die, the paths they had walked would never fade since their friends would take it even further.[11]







History
Zero Two was created by Dr. FRANXX out of the Klaxosaur Princess's DNA. Many specimens like Zero Two herself were born but failed to survive; making her the only successful human-klaxo sapiens hybrid. Dr. FRANXX also created clones using Zero Two's cells; the 9's, but they didn't inherit the Klaxosaur blood. Due to Zero Two being the only specimen with Klaxosaur blood to survive, she was decided to operate the Star Entity; a collective mass of Klaxosaurs which can only be operated by a Klaxo-sapien, on humanity's behalf. Because of her high Parasite potential and potential in general, she received the code number "002".[12]

OniFloor
Zero Two as a child in her room.

Zero Two did not receive the same regular training as other children in the Garden to become a Parasite, since she had been trapped in her room for as long as she could remember, which she described as being the entirety of her world. Occasionally, a woman would enter Zero Two's room to bring her food, and she thought that she was probably a stand-in for a mother. She would bring Zero Two food and pet her head. One day, she appeared for the last time with something that wasn't food; a picture book called "The Beast and the Prince". Zero Two tried to eat and break it at first, and her "mother" flipped open the page to which she was amazed by its bright colors and different shapes. Though it had words, she couldn't read them. Despite that, Zero Two described the book as her first "pretty thing." Thanks to the picture book, Zero Two was sure the outside world surely had many more things to offer; though she added that she was half right and half wrong.

02Testing
An experiment being carried out on Zero Two.

One day, Zero Two was taken along for experiments. In the testing room, Dr. FRANXX was amazed how she developed such a human form. With Zero Two tethered, a laser was centered on her palm and when it fired, she screamed in pain. Dr. FRANXX was amazed at how quickly her wound healed and how her skin regrew. After her testing, Zero Two was isolated in yet another room. In the room, she was seen struggling against an adult to get her picture book back, and she soon managed to take the book back and the woman gave up. After that, Zero Two was put through even more painful experiments due to her special abilities. Since Hiro had witnessed Zero Two's suffering several times by then, he made up his mind that he was unwilling to watch her suffer anymore. When Hiro came to rescue her, scaling one of the trees near her cell, Zero Two had just gone through testing and was curled up on the floor, taking the picture book in her bosom as a sense of comfort. Hiro shattered her window with a searchlight and although Zero Two was initially aggressive, she was moved by Hiro's tears and began crawling towards his outstretched hand. When they got out however, the branch broke and they fell to the ground, causing Hiro to lose consciousness.

Zero Two proceeded to carry Hiro through the snow and she was amazed by the outside world. She noticed a pair of mice and chased after them. When Hiro regained consciousness, he saw her about to eat one of them. When he tried to stop her, she bit his hand and he caressed her head to comfort her, which reminded her of her ‘mother’, and she let go. Hiro then realized that Zero Two couldn't understand him but he introduced himself anyway. Though he asked for her name, she couldn't answer, less speak, but Hiro saw that her code was "002." He thought of a name, first thinking "Oni" and then "Zero Two", but he wasn't particularly fond of either of those names. However, when Zero Two began trying to say "Zero Two" continuously, to which Hiro thought that he should have thought of a better name but began to call her that himself. After that, the two continued and enjoyed their "adventure" together. Zero Two also noted that although she didn't understand his words, she knew his voice called to her, and she saw and learned new things with him, as well as walked with him. He also gave her some candy, to with Zero Two reacted fondly to. Now feeling comfortable with Hiro, Zero Two showed him her book, "The Beast and the Prince". As Hiro began reading, a group of adults appeared, looking for them. The two hid and Hiro promised to protect Zero Two.

The two continued to flee from the adults and eventually ended up sitting under a mistletoe, with Hiro continuing reading the book. Hiro noted how sad the story was due to the fact that the Beast Princess and Prince couldn't be together since both weren't human. This made Hiro relate to his current situation, giving Zero Two a sad smile to which she wryly smiled back at him.

02Engaged
Zero Two is ecstatic by Hiro words that he'll be her darling.

Soon after, Hiro said that they should get going, but Zero had scraped her knee and couldn't walk well. He searched for something to bandage it but was forced to lick her blood instead. With Hiro kneeling before her, Zero Two confused his pose with the prince in the page mentioning "marriage", proposing. As Zero Two questioned "marriage", Hiro explained what it was and said that they would marry once they escaped. He told her he wanted to be with her forever too and become her darling. She began crying tears of joy and hugged him close, now thinking that she could have something beautiful with him. However, they were interrupted and cornered by a group of adults. Though Hiro tried to protect her, he was shot and fell to the ground bleeding. As Zero Two tried to resist from being captured by the adults, she saw Hiro who had been shot and cried and shouted out for her "darling".

TwoBed
Zero Two and Hiro getting their memories erased.

After that, their memories were erased. However, Zero Two's memories couldn't be completely erased since the adults noted that there was some strong force protecting the memories she made with Hiro. In the aftermath, Zero Two did retain some vague memories from the meeting with Hiro but she forgot about the person she made the memories with. She was devastated by the fact that they couldn't be together due to the apparent fact that they weren't the same creatures with blood of different colors. To be sure she could become human and never forget about the memories with her "darling", she ate the picture book's pages and began speaking and acting likeas had learned from her meeting with Hiro. Every once in a while, she snuck back to the tree, hoping to find Hiro waiting for her there. At one point, when she got to the tree, she was surrounded by Klaxosaurs.

Since Zero Two's meeting with Hiro did leave a huge impression on her, she swore since that day to become human since if she were like him, they could always be together. To make her even more determined, she was also convinced into thinking that she could become human by killing Klaxosaurs by Papa and the others.[1][13][9]

Two years prior to the main storyline, Zero Two fought alongside the squad of Plantation 26 in a critical battle. She was reckless and showed no concern for others; causing the death of 090's partner.

Episode 01: Alone and Lonesome
Zero Two is seen on the carrier flight with Dr. FRANXX and Nana. She says she wants to take a bath and asks if there is an ocean at Plantation 13. Nana says there is no such thing and asks if she can just take a shower. Zero Two replies she is in the mood for swim. She then licks her wrist and says she hates how she tastes. Upon landing, Zero Two runs off from the others and mocks them with a smirk and throws away her hat.

Zero Two is later spotted by Hiro skinny dipping in a lake near Miltisteinn. She disappears under the water's surface, prompting Hiro to assume she is drowning and in need of rescue. Zero Two jumps out of the water with a live fish in her mouth. She spits out the fish and licks herself believing that she will taste "salty", to her disappointment. Zero Two, in the nude, begins to converse with Hiro and thanks him for jumping in to save her. She then tackles him into the water and licks his cheek, remarking that he tastes "dangerous" and she loves it. His "taste", coupled with the fact that he was not afraid of her horns prompts her to propose that he become her "Darling". Before Hiro can accept, Nana and 081 arrive to retrieve her. Hiro calls for her, ad asks her for her name. Dismissively, she questions if parasites even have names. She tells him her code is 002, and that everyone calls her "Zero Two".

During the welcoming ceremony, a klaxosaur appears and attacks the new FRANXX, damaging the garage. Zero Two piloting Strelizia saves the Parasites, notably Goro and Ichigo, from a would-be particle beam. Strelizia and the klaxosaur battle, causing catastrophic damage to the outer wall of The Plantation. Strelizia is overcome and is flung into a section of The Plantation, crashing where Hiro had been viewing the battle.

Zero Two and Hiro's first kiss
Zero Two and Hiro's first kiss to reactivate Iron Maiden Strelizia

The lifeless body of Zero Two's partner, 081, drops out of the derelict Strelizia. Zero Two emerges from the wreckage, bloodied, and tells Hiro she'll have to pilot the Strelizia alone as "she always has". Hiro reprimands her that if she pilots a FRANXX in her current state, she'll die. Zero Two claims she isn't afraid of death, and if she doesn't do it countless more people will die from the klaxosaur attack. Hiro declares that he will ride with her. Zero Two asks if he is ready to die which Hiro states "he doesn't know but he may very well be if he cannot pilot a FRANXX". Zero Two sees Hiro's tears and extends her hand to him, mirroring their initial meeting at the lake. She tells him of how it has been a long time since she's seen a human cry, and how it makes her heart race. Hiro takes her hand and she pulls him into the cockpit, declaring him her "Darling" and they kiss. The kiss reactivates the Strelizia and the Hiro-Zero Two pairing unlocks its "Iron Maiden" form to the amazement of Dr. FRANXX and everyone else.

Iron Maiden Strelizia overpowers the klaxosaur and destroys its core, effectively killing the mechanical beast. In the aftermath, repairs are being done to the damage of the klaxosaur attack, Zero Two carrying an unconscious Hiro alight from the now deactivated Iron Maiden Strelizia. Nana tells Squad 13 that Zero Two works directly under APE and possesses Klaxosaur blood. Ichigo Realizes Zero Two is the girl from the rumors Zorome was talking about, in which her partners die after three rides.

Zero Two gazes into the sunset and shoots Hiro a gleeful smile, saying, "I found you, my Darling!"

Episode 02: What it Means to Connect
EP2-0
"You were incredible, Darling~"

Zero Two unexpectedly visits Miltisteinn to have breakfast with Hiro, but much to the bemusement of the other parasites. She completely covers her meal in honey and proceeds to eat it with her bare hands to the disgust of all the Parasites except Hiro. She is approached by Zorome in an attempt to "hit on her" while putting down Hiro. She begins to wipe her honeyed hand on his uniform, mortifying Zorome. Zero Two takes the pitcher of honey and starts sitting with Hiro and begins pouring honey all over his breakfast as well. When asked by Hiro as to whether or not he actually was able to activate and pilot Strelizia with her, she reassures him, stating that he was "amazing" and calls him "darling", much to the shock of the other Parasites (and to Ichigo's chagrin in particular).

Nana enters the room and informs them that Zero Two is on "standby" awaiting further orders from HQ. She also commands her to go back to her own table before Zero Two leaves with her. On the elevator, Nana criticizes her for running off. Zero Two antagonizes Nana by stating that she merely wanted to have breakfast with her darling. Nana orders her to avoid the parasites, as they are nowhere ready for Zero Two’s league. They arrive at the city and Zero Two remarks how she feels like she suffocated there.

Later in the hangar, Zero Two is confronted by Ichigo. Ichigo thanks Zero Two for saving their lives but warns her to stay away from Hiro so as not to get his hopes up and hurt him, declaring that she is not part of "their" squad. Zero Two approaches her and asks Ichigo what she is to her darling. Ichigo states that she is the leader of the squad. Zero Two begins to sniff her and lick her cheek astonishing Ichigo. Zero Two says she tastes "sweet" and that she likes her taste before gleefully leaving.

During the discussion for Hiro's parasite promotion test, Zero Two volunteers to be his partner, him being her darling. Zero Two's proposal is met with harsh resistance by Ichigo, stating that she is not part of the squad and that if the test is merely to measure Hiro's aptitude it should work with her; having Zero Two participate would be unnecessary. Nana informs Zero Two that HQ hasn't authorized the use of the Strelizia so Hiro will have to perform with one of his squadmates. Zero Two concedes, stating that her injuries haven't completely healed yet. She allows Ichigo to have Hiro, telling her to go for it "this one time" and to make sure to take care of "her" darling.

After Ichigo's subsequent failure to properly pilot with Hiro, Zero Two is shown flipping her hair in the wind and triumphantly eating her lollipop while leaving the training grounds.

Episode 03: Fighting Puppet
EP3-0
Zero Two temporarily partners with Mitsuru

Zero Two is first shown waiting for Hiro to finish his solo training. After he finishes, he finds her asleep in an atrium. Once she wakes up, she takes him around the facility. However, due to Hiro's status, he has limited access to certain areas, whereas Zero Two has an S-Class ID which implies unrestricted access. Thinking quickly, Zero Two takes Hiro's hand and they "waltz" through the doors, tricking the system.

Upon gaining access, Zero Two leads Hiro to the Inner City of Plantation 13. While Hiro is awestruck by the view, Zero Two overlooks the city melancholically. Hiro shoots her a grateful look, and she asks him why he's staring at her. Hiro replies that he's trying to think of a name for her. Zero Two says she is fine with just Zero Two, even though Hiro thinks it must be boring being called by her code number. She then jumps the rail and begins to walk out onto the ledge. She expresses her depressive view of the city, its inhabitants and life. Zero Two then asks Hiro to run away with her, offering to get him out of the plantation. Before Hiro can answer, Zero Two pretends to fall but actually somersaults back to the safety of the balcony. She lightly jokes that she was kidding.

Zero Two appears next when the underground mission against the Conrad-class klaxosaur went awry. While the team celebrates their apparent victory, Zero Two shows up in a dark corner remarking that it isn't over. All of a sudden a swarm of similar klaxosaurs and a giant version of the initial one begin to ambush the FRANXXs. As the situation grows increasingly dire, Zero Two consistently prods Nana into letting her ride with Hiro in order to save them. Nana persistently denies her, till Hiro submits the Zero Two ride with Mitsuru, the only available "official" stamen, in order to save the squad. Zero Two is greatly disappointed in Hiro, giving him the silent treatment as she begrudgingly embarks partnered with Mitsuru.

The pair then race to rescue the squad. Initially, Mitsuru pilots the Sterlizia on par with Hiro, proposing that Zero Two take him on as her "official partner". Zero Two puts him to the test and goes "all out", prompting Nana to initiate the retrieval of Strelizia. A bloodied deactivated Strelizia emerges in the aftermath. Zero Two emerges from the robot and gives Hiro a light wave and smile. Mitsuru does not emerge from the FRANXX. He is shown to have passed out in the cockpit, bloodied and broken, on the brink of death. Zero Two says Mitsuru is not fit to be her darling, only Hiro is.

Zero Two and Hiro hijacking Strelizia

In the aftermath of Mitsuru's near-death experience, Zero Two is told to return to the frontlines by Nana on Papa's orders and the Strelizia is grounded, much to Zero Two's dismay. She remarks all the parasites are nothing but an annoyance and will die sooner or later anyway. Nana counters they are still her fellow parasite comrades, which Zero Two scoffs. Hachi states she is special, which offends Zero Two because she assumes he means about her not being human, but he elaborates he meant her abilities.

Zero Two looks at Strelizia in the docking lounge as the plantation goes into mobile mode. Nearby, Hiro sees her and hides. However, Zero Two realizes he is there but she simply walks away. Afterwards, she finds Hiro in the bathroom as he takes a bath and she walks into the bathtub, cornering him against the wall. She asks him to run away with her and leave his "weakling" comrades. Her mood dampens by Hiro's visible fear of her as he stares at her horns and gulps. She asks him if he's like everyone else; if he thinks "she's a monster". Before he can reply, the alarm goes off.

A giant centipede-like razor klaxosaur attacks the carrier sent to acquire Zero Two. Plantation 13's Parasites are deployed to combat it, only to be ambushed seemingly by another klaxosaur. Zero Two and Hiro change into their suits and rush into the situation room when Nana tells her that it won't change her decision, that the Strelizia is not authorized to "fly". Zero Two asks why is there an assault ship here, much to Hiro’s surprise.

At this point, armed security personnel arrive to collect Zero Two, as Papa has ordered her to return with Strelizia to the front lines by any means necessary. Zero Two gives a long goodbye to Hiro remarking about how she "felt like things could work out too" and that she wanted to be with him. In lieu of a kiss, Zero Two pokes his forehead with her horns and departs with the soldiers.

While being escorted by the guards to the carrier, Hiro catches up to her, however unable to reach her due to restriction system. Hiro begins to shout out to her and apologize for his prior hesitation in the bath. Hiro explains that his fear was not of her inhumanity, but a lack of his own resolve. Hiro confesses that he doesn't care about riding the FRANXX and that he just wants to ride with Zero Two, begging her not to go. Zero Two pauses in the face of his confession. She then does a backflip, disarming one guard and using his rifle to crack the glass barrier above Hiro. She performs an aerial flip, breaking through the glass to reach Hiro. Now reunited with a bashful Hiro, she coaxes him to reaffirm his confession, asking him, "You wanna ride me, huh?". Hiro affirms that he does and Zero Two asks him to say it one more time; he then shouts it out for her.

Zero Two takes Hiro in her arms and they assume their waltzed pose in order to pass the security restrictions and break through to the Strelizia. Once in the cockpit, Nana orders them over the comm to get out and that they do not have permission to launch. Zero Two declares she's going out with her darling and cuts Nana off mid-sentence. Hiro pauses, due to his anxiety of failing to pilot a FRANXX yet again. Zero Two reassures him that he can do it, later rephrasing it to "they" can do this. Now revitalized by Zero Two's encouragement, they pair-up and the Strelizia destroys the carrier and takes to the skies, en route to rescue the Parasites once again.

Realizing the Klaxosaur is too long and big, the squad comes up with a strategy; by restraining it and opening it up, Strelizia will be able to go inside it and reach the core. The other FRANXX do this, with Delphinium and Chlorophytum opening its mouth whereas Genista and Argentea hold its body down. Strelizia enters through its mouth and gives Delphinium (Ichigo) a smirk, which catches Ichigo off guard momentarily. Strelizia travels inside the Klaxosaur and destroys the core as soon as Strelizia reaches the end of the Klaxosaur.

Episode 05: Your Thorn, My Badge
EP5-0
Hiro's tumor, having emerged after his second time piloting with Zero Two

Zero Two is seen waiting for Hiro so that they can have breakfast together. She insists on sitting beside Hiro at Futoshi's expense, thereby forcing Futoshi to sit at the girl's table by Kokoro's invitation. While Ichigo gives the morning prayer, Zero Two is hard at work slathering her entire breakfast (and Hiro's) with honey. She then begins feeding Hiro to the disgust of Goro and the jealousy of Zorome. Futoshi and Kokoro imitate them while Ichigo silently ponders into her teacup.

After breakfast, Hiro gives Zero Two a tour of The Birdcage and their life as parasites. Zero Two then divulges that she'll soon be living there too, her announcement causes displeasure among the Parasites, especially from Ichigo who immediately confronts Nana about this development. Ichigo accepts her stay as the will of Papa then personally sees Zero Two to her accommodations. Ichigo prepares Zero Two’s room in the attic, much to Zero Two’s disappointment that Ichigo won’t let her share a room with Hiro. Ichigo lays down the rules, making Zero two call her “bossy”.

During the joint briefing between Plantations 13 and 26, Hachi informs them that Zero Two and the Strelizia will guard the main pipeline during the kissing. The plan is met with strong opposition by the leader of the Plantation 26 parasites. He recounts an operation from 2 years prior with Zero and his Parasites. He denounces Zero Two as "reckless and shows no concern for others". He even divulges that she is the reason his previous partner is dead. Zero Two utters "Weaklings die, Big Deal". 090 is about to attack Zero Two until Hiro intervenes and defends her honor, thus defusing the situation.

Later that night, Goro spots Ichigo and Zero Two sneaking out at midnight. Apparently Ichigo pulled Zero Two aside to ensure she stay in line for the upcoming mission. Zero Two dismisses her for being bossy again and begins to leave. Ichigo grabs her wrist and begins to beg Zero Two not to push Hiro too hard. Ripping herself from Ichigo's grasp, Zero Two responds that "darling (Hiro) said that he wanted to ride with her". Ichigo continues to beg her not to put a heavy burden on Hiro. Zero Two questions Ichigo if she wants Hiro and reminds her that she tried to ride with him and that "they" didn't work. Ichigo exclaimed to leave her out of it; Zero Two tells her that she should stay out of it. Ichigo asks if she's trying to "suck him dry", Zero Two declares "darling belongs to me". An agitated Ichigo warns her that Hiro could die. Zero Two brushes it off saying that he could, and if he did then he wouldn't have amounted to much. Angered and frustrated, Ichigo calls her heartless and inhuman. She then slaps Zero Two hard so hard that it damages her headband, knocking it off. Zero Two becomes enraged, her eyes and horns start to glow a malevolent red. The red-eyed Zero Two, glaring at Ichigo, questions her on what it means to be "human". Frightened by the being before her, Ichigo runs back to the birdcage in tears and it starts to rain. Zero Two is calmed by the feeling of the rainfall.

Hiro02 Ep
Zero Two and Hiro after rain

The next morning, Hiro goes outside and approaches a soaked Zero Two by the lake. It is implied she spent the rest of the night out in the rain. Zero Two tells him that everything smells nice after it rains. Zero Two reminisces of the time they first met. Hiro thanks her, stating that the reason he's still there is because of her and that she gave him the chance to pilot a FRANXX. Zero Two unzips his uniform revealing a blue tumor. Zero Two asks him if it hurts and if he wants to walk away from being her partner. Hiro admits that it hurts, but confirms that he'll ride with her. Zero Two smiles and begins to joyfully laugh and dance, having found someone willing to give his life for her.

Episode 06: DARLING in the FRANXX
Dar... ling
Zero Two calmed by a fully-healed Hiro

On the dawn of the mission, Hiro spots Zero Two exiting the pistil changing room. She glances back at him but doesn't approach as Ichigo is present. Hiro quickly ends his conversation with Ichigo and meets up with Zero Two. She asks him if he is ready and he affirms he is.

During the defence of the kissing, Zero Two and Hiro and oversee the battle while guarding the main pipeline, much to her boredom. Zero Two remarks that the Plantation 13 parasites' tactics are all over the place and that they're barely hanging in there, as they are being overwhelmed by just 4 Conrad-class klaxosaurs, in contrast to the other squad's calculated and efficient method of combat. Hiro asks Zero Two why she fights klaxosaurs because it looks like she enjoys it. After a moment of silence, she replies that the reason is that she's a monster. Zero Two shoots the question back at an unsure Hiro, who shrugs and states it's to protect Papa and all the adults in the plantations. Zero Two remarks his answer is lame. Hiro proposes that if the squad needs their help they should move out, to which Zero Two agrees.

Zero Two and Hiro charge into battle and begins killing the klaxosaurs in bundles. Ichigo tells Strelizia (Zero Two) to go back but Zero Two ignores her. 090 also tells Zero Two to return to her position but, as Zero Two doesn’t reply, Hiro says they are only helping their teammates. Once the minor klaxosaurs have been wiped out due to the collective efforts of both squads (and mostly the Strelizia), Target Beta, initially a massive cube-klaxosaur with horns transforms into a humanoid form and begins its advance to the pipeline. Hiro's health deteriorates as a result of clearing the minor klaxosaurs, Zero Two checks in on him reminding him that Target Beta is a real threat. Once the parasites pin down Target Beta, the Strelizia flies into the air. Hiro aims to finish it in one-blow with a downward thrust as his final act. The attack was seemingly successful as Target Beta collapses. However, Target Beta punches Strelizia off and quickly reassembles itself once again, this time into a battering ram preparing to attack Strelizia. Then, Strelizia deactivates, showing Hiro has died at the cost of that last strike.

The Strelizia takes the full brunt of Target Beta's attack, sending it crashing into the main pipeline. With the link between Zero Two and Hiro now disconnected, Strelizia enters Stampede form, much to the horror of his squadmates. She attempts to retaliate, however futile and is embedded in the pipeline as Target Beta continually rams into it. Zero Two devolves into a primal state as she desperately tries to defend against the unending attack. Hiro miraculously revives, and the traces of the tumor rapidly disappear. She is calmed by Hiro with an embrace, declaring he's her partner and he won't leave her alone. The Strelizia returns to it's Iron Maiden Form and knocks down Target Beta, rekindling the hope and amazement of everyone (especially Dr. FRANXX). Squad 13 repeats the earlier maneuver but with an upward strike. The attack shoots Target Beta into the sky as wings of light appear and impale it, finally putting an end to the gargantuan.

In the aftermath, a fatigued Zero Two is carried by Hiro of out Strelizia this time. She hears Hiro tell her that he wants to be her wings and he'll be fine afterwards. Standing apart from the celebration, Zero Two watches them. She turns to the Strelizia contemplating that she has to kill more and more klaxosaurs.

Episode 07: Shooting Star Moratorium
Zero Two tells Dr. FRANXX that they didn't have to come all the way. Nana introduces Hiro to Dr. FRANXX, the creator of FRANXX. She begins to introduce a boy, but he stops her. He approaches Hiro and says that he's the first person to survive Zero Two. He says that he has an interest in them. Hachi tells the doctor that Strelizia and Code 002 are transferred into Plantation 13's purview. He waves at him and says that the geezers already told him. When Hachi announces that they're officially partners, Zero Two hugs Hiro.

Dr. FRANXX tells Hiro not to let him consume his emotions if he wants to always be her partner. Otherwise, he'll suffer.

Zero Two and Hiro play in the water.

Later, after the successful kissing with Plantation 26, Squad 13 is given a special vacation. Zero Two, along with a majority of the other children, is excited to be at the ocean. She pulls Hiro to the water. She splashes him and they laugh together.

Hiro follows Zero Two into the water and the three boys begin watching them. She notes how nice it feels to swim in the ocean. Hiro seems embarrassed when he looks at her and she asks what's wrong. He says she looks good, but he can't look her in the eyes. She thanks him for all he did for her.

Zero Two seems to be about to kiss Hiro, but she instead licks his cheek. She teasingly asks what he was expecting. She says that a kiss is a declaration that the other person belongs to you and you should only kiss the person you love. She asks if he maybe kissed someone else. Before he can answer, Goro, Zorome, and Futoshi pull Hiro under the water, leaving her alone in the water.

OceanTownClose
The parasites are led to a town.

Mitsuru tells the group that he found something strange and leads the group through a thin pass. Zero Two walks along at the back of the group through the pass and the forest path before being brought to what appears to be a city. Zorome comments that it's nothing like the cities that adults live in. Kokoro asks if people live there, and Mitsuru replies that he'd never heard of anyone living outside the plantations.

Ichigo comes to a bookstore where she sees a poster featuring a kissing couple. She thinks of her and Hiro's kiss and touches her lip. Zero Two suddenly says behind her that she did it with Hiro. Ichigo is startled and asks her what she means. She answers "kiss" and says that she probably isn't ready for it yet. Ichigo says that she has too. Zero Two asks with who and says that it should only be shared with someone special. She asks if that person was special to her. Before she can answer, Goro calls her and he and Hiro wave them over.

They walk back to the rest of the group and Miku says that she's exhausted. Kokoro agrees. Zorome wonders about the city and Ikuno says that they can be sure that it was part of civilization. Goro asks if people lived there in the past. Zero Two answers that they abandoned it and that humans used to live on the surface. She says that there are tons of places like that around the world.

Back at the beach, food had been delivered. They all begin eating and Goro hands Zero Two a shish kabob. She tells Hiro that she's going to go swimming before running off to the sea.

Hiro asks why they think humanity abandoned the surface and wonders if humanity hadn't started extracting magma energy if the klaxosaurs wouldn't have shown up. Mitsuru asks if he's doubting Papa and the rest. He says that they moved into plantations in order to protect mankind. This pumps Zorome up, to Mitsuru's disdain, and Futoshi as well. Zorome asks if he agrees and when he shyly answers, he asks why he's acting so aloof when he's their teammate. Miku says that they have to put in both his and Naomi's share of the work. Kokoro says that she finds it reassuring that they're with them. Futoshi and Goro agree. Ichigo stands and officially welcomes him and Zero Two to the squad. He thanks them all.

When Zorome finds a crab, Futoshi wants to eat it. Mitsuru is surprised that he still wants to eat, causing the others to laugh. Zero Two watches this from the water.

Episode 08: Boys × Girls
As the parasites are fighting a klaxosaur, it spews goo. It leaks into the cockpits and melts the girls' parasite suits. Though the boys begin spacing out, they don't tell the girls and they finish off the klaxosaur. Hiro finally tells Zero Two and the rest of the girls realize what's happened.

The girls cover themselves with a towel and glare at their partners. Besides Zero Two, who doesn't seem to mind. When Hiro tries to defuse the situation he says that Zero Two said it is better that parasites are a bit pervy, which she confirms. This annoys the girls further.

ZeroTwoFoot

As a result, the girls split the house which Zero Two finds very strange but upon seeing Hiro she ignores the split and spends time close to him. As the boys blocked off the kitchen Zero Two walks in and Miku attempts to follow her, but the other girls pull her back. In the yard, she plays with a ball as Hiro says that everyone's gotten too stubborn and they need to do something. But she thinks the opposite and that they need to spice it up a bit.

Zero Two approaches the girls and licks Ikuno and saying she tastes a secret and begins to walk away, but is halted by Miku. In one of the girls' bedrooms, she was asked by Miku whose side she's on. She says that they're just playing around, but Ichigo says they're serious. Hearing that, Zero Two decides to play along.

02StealsClothes
Zero Two leads Hiro to chase her

She changes the girl's only bath sign to allow boys and when they enter naked, the girls are already bathing. Then, Zero Two runs out with their clothes and Hiro chases her, asking how she could do that to them. She says because they are fighting and leads him on a chase throughout the house. They meet on the roof where Hiro begins laughing after she throws their clothes in the air, laughing and calling Hiro a pervert. Hiro starts laughing and asks why she did it. She says she wanted to take part in a human fight and asks him if she looks human to him now before falling from the roof. As Hiro runs to try to help her, she reflexes into safely landing to the ground and gives Hiro a smile as they look at each other.

And yet, she and the others are scolded by Nana and Hachi after they get dressed. In the girl's room, Zero Two is giddy at how naughty and rebellious the incident was. The girls want an explanation. Zero Two tells them if they half-ass things, they'll end up adults. She says to say what they want because they'll all die sooner or later before leaving.

Zero Two is among the parasites when they find Miku. When they wonder what the room is, Zero Two says that it's probably one of the rooms the former Squad 13 used. Zorome questions what happened and Zero Two says they were obviously wiped out.

Later on, Zorome and Miku are seen bickering before they enter their FRANXX. Hiro says that he wants to get to know Zero Two better. She tells him to grab on and never let go of her.

Episode 09: Triangle Bomb
At the beginning of the episode, the members of Squad 13, with the exception of Zero Two, receive presents from Papa. When she sees Hiro's requested present is a book, Zero Two's attention is riveted, and she asks if it is a picture book. When he replies in the negative, Zero Two is shown to have a rather disappointed face.

Later that morning, Hiro presents her with an item that had once belonged to his former (and likely deceased) partner Naomi: A silver-finished hand mirror. He explains that he noticed Papa had given her nothing, and so as a result decided to make sure she also has a gift. Zero Two reacts by putting her arms around Hiro, thanking him for thinking of her.

She says they can understand each other just fine while piloting Strelizia and otherwise is an annoyance before she walks away.

However, she holds back when he notices her canines and coldly turns away.

At the lab, Hachi tells Zero Two that she will undergo thorough tests but she asks for a pass. Nana says they can keep putting it off. The squad is greeted by the 9’s and Alpha asks her if she came for maintenance but she ignores him. She later fights against a group of soldiers who try to take her into the lab. One tranquilizes her and they hold her down.

She keeps stabbing the klaxosaur and repeatedly screams for it to die, shocking Hiro and the others. The next day, Zero Two begins destroying every mirror in Miltisteinn and the mirror Hiro have her as a gift. The squad later goes against another klaxosaur but when Zero Two again starts to lose control, Hiro tries restraining her.

Their minds intersect and she begins strangling Hiro, who starts to see her memories.

Episode 13: The Beast and the Prince
Hiro connects deeply with the consciousness of Zero Two and catches a glimpse of memories that she retained but he forgot from their childhood. Hiro sees how Zero Two endured torturous experiments from Dr. FRANXX and received a picture book called The Beast and the Prince, which was her one source of comfort, from a caretaker. Zero Two and Hiro caught their first glimpse of each other when she was being dragged into the lab, where she experienced painful experiments if a laser blowing a hole through her hand. A caretaker tries to take her book from her but Zero Two fought back until the woman gave up.

After suffering from electroshock treatment, Hiro helped her escape by breaking the window in her room and Zero Two notes that was her first time experiencing the outside world and the environment confused her, as it was different. She tried eating a mouse and impulsively bit Hiro’s hand when he tried to stop her but he soon realized she didn’t understand what he was saying. He tried thinking of a name for her; his first choice was ‘Oni’ but then thought of Zero Two, although he said it wasn’t good either. She tried pronouncing ‘Zero Two’ but couldn’t because of her speech impairment. Hiro then suggested they go somewhere far away.

Zero Two narrates she didn’t understand his words but knew his voice called to her, she saw things with him and walked with him, and all the moments they shared were fun. She was given a piece of candy by Hiro which delighted her. Feeling comfortable around him she showed him the picture book before they were forced to hide from some guards who were tracking them.

The two later sat in front of a tree while Hiro read the book, which he noted was sad because the beast and prince couldn’t get married. Zero Two was curious about what ‘marry’ meant, and he explained it was when two people who loved each other make a vow to be together forever. However, he thought it would mean the two would have to be human. She smiled at him and Hiro suggested they keep walking but noticed she had a cut in her knee. He was surprised to see blue blood from her wound and licked it. She compared his knee position to a proposal based on the wedding page and asked Hiro if this is marriage. He said once they get out of here because he wanted to be with her forever too and become her darling. She began crying and hugged Hiro to what Zero Two now believed those were tears of joy. The two realized they were sitting in front of a mistletoe tree but were then found by a group of soldiers, who knocked Hiro unconscious and grabbed Zero Two.

Since then, she has vowed to become human no matter what because she always believed she could do anything with him. After a collision with Delphinium and hearing Ichigo's words.

Zero Two is banned from seeing Hiro

Hachi announced they must neutralize every klaxosaur inhabiting Gran Crevasse. Nana says that it is a joint operation with the 9's and FRANXX squad from each plantation. He says that Squad 13 is scheduled to be part of the sixth wave. Nana says it will be their most difficult mission and Ichigo raises her hand. She asks that Zero Two is removed from Squad 13 as of that mission and, if not, Squad 13 will not participate in the operation. Nana says that she was set to return to the 9's as of the mission anyway. Zero Two protests, but the parasites stop her from seeing him.

When Hiro gets up, he is stopped by Miku. Zero Two is also guarded and prevented from leaving her room. She tells him that Zero Two is returning to the 9's the next night.

Zero Two remembers what Ichigo said and thinks that she knew she could never be a human. She breaks out of her room as Ichigo returns and roughly throws Goro against a window. However, she was scolded by Ichigo and asks if she wants to lie to him again. She says she's wrong and just wants to talk to him.

Goro tells Ichigo to let her see him and Kokoro agrees, stating that it's sad to see them apart. Goro says that she can meet him, but they're all going to be there. When they enter the room, it's empty. Hiro had used the knife to make a rope out the curtains. He then tied the knife to it and climbed upstairs, escaping containment.

Zero Two's horns break and Hiro hugs her. She pushes him away and tells him not to look at her because of how she used him. He says that doesn’t matter anymore. She cries out that she called him fodder and how can he ever forgive her. He cries that he called her a monster and hugs her, saying they are even. She says she is a monster. But Hiro says no and they need to talk things out, as their future is ahead of them and they have the chance to see the world when they didn’t back then. Hiro kisses her as they both begin to give way to their emotions. Through their tears of joy, Strelitzia emerges, more powerful than ever and with an inverted color scheme.

Zero Two finds Hiro and Mitsuru inspecting the water of a lake and tells them breakfast is ready. While everyone preps for breakfast, Ikuno enters and offers to help, but Ichigo says that it's fine and asks if her fever went down. Zero Two places her forehead on Ikuno and says that she's 36.7 degrees (a normal body temperature) but tells her not to push herself.

They pray for Papa before they eat, though Zero Two eats anyway. She lists off the chores and Miku, smiling, notes that she's meticulous. Ichigo also smiles and agrees.

Hiro and Zero Two walk together. Hiro says that Goro must have gotten child fever last week. Zero Two curiously looks at a plant. He explains that they're sakura buds including that they're a really pretty color, like her hair. She giggles and says she wants to see them. He asks how she felt about their lives and she says they're having fun and would like to live like that forever. He scooches closer to her and is about to hold her hand, but she suddenly remembers that she was supposed to go bathing with the other pistils, telling him not to peek.

Miku wonders what is wrong but Zero Two playfully tackles her again.

The parasites meet in their living room and Ichigo says that they have five sources they can use for drinking water. Mitsuru says that only two of them are only usable with filtering. Ikuno asks if they can repair the circulation system themselves. Hiro says that Mistilteinn doesn't have the equipment. Futoshi says that their access to the elevator is restricted too. Zorome asks why they don't send a letter to Papa and ask him to fix it. Goro says that he doesn't think there'd be a point. The parasites sadly reflect on their vulnerability, so Zero Two says that they should cook their own food. The others agreed

Ichigo welcomes Hiro, Goro, and Zero Two back from fishing. Zorome and the rest are impressed with the 11 fish that she caught. Goro caught 9 and Hiro, awkwardly smiled and scratched his head, saying he didn't catch any. Zero Two says she'll teach him later. The others want to try fishing as well.

Goro asks Ichigo how she is, and she says that the mood really changed. She happily watches as Zero Two tells the rest how to fish. Ichigo says that Hiro was right about her being a normal girl. She says she wants what's best for her and Hiro.

That night, Kokoro and Miku sleep together. Zero Two draws pictures in her room of the book they read together. When Hiro says that it's a sad story, she says that it was her first "pretty thing." She met him and wanted to have something beautiful with him. She realizes now what it means to be human and they embrace.

As she lays out her drawings for her picture book, she is about to draw on a piece of paper until she hears a klaxosaur scream from the Gran Crevasse.

Episode 17: Eden
Ikuno holds a mirror for Zero Two as she files her horns. She asks if it hurts and she says not a bit at all. When she finishes, she tells Miku. She presents a flower headband and places it on her head. Zero Two asks what it looks like and Miku says perfect and that Hiro will love it. Zorome suddenly runs up and says there's a problem.

The Nines later arrived at Mistillteinn on Papa's order. 9'α and Zero Two had a private chat in the woods. Smiling, 9'α asks how long she's going to play human since she'll never be the same as them. Though they're unique, they're imperfect unlike she and the other nines. She tells him not to call her "Iota" but "Zero Two." He asks if she's throwing away the Special Forces code name that Papa gave her. She says that her darling gave it to her and it's important. He begins laughing at her as she walks away. He wishes her luck, again calling her "Iota."

Zero Two looks at the flame of a candle in her room when Hiro calls out to her. He asks about her flower headband. She says that Miku made it for her. She shyly tells him not to stare but says it's okay after he compliments her.

Zero Two pushes his bangs back to reveal small blue horns poking through his forehead. She says that they'd grown bigger. She thinks that they must be because he rode with her or because he drank her blood. She sadly says that she drastically altered his destiny. He leans in and places his horns against hers. They kiss and rest their foreheads against each other. Blushing, Hiro says that it makes him happy to be more similar to her.

She tells him that she ate her old picture book when they were trying to erase her memories. She says that she started wanting to become human because she wanted to see him again and was told that she could do that by killing klaxosaurs, and yet realizes she shouldn't have believed them. Hiro asks if Papa and the rest told her, but she doesn't answer.

She asks that he show her the picture he drew. He refuses, so she playfully snatches it from him. She finds that he crudely drew a picture of a king. She begins laughing and he covers his face in embarrassment. She says that it's approved and she loves it as she holds it against her chest.

The next day, she sees that 9'α had been poking around and conflict arose as interrogates Kokoro on the childbirth book. A harsh exchange of words soon followed, with Ikuno slapping 9'α. Afterwards upon hearing Kokoro's words Zero Two was amazed by humans because they were to leave a mark which was something she couldn't do and as well as decide their own fates. She later shows Hiro her drawing of a bride.

Episode 18: When the Sakura Blooms
Hiro explains to the parasites that he wants to have a wedding. As they don't know what it is, Hiro explains that it was a ceremony where two people would make a vow together. Miku asks who will get married. Hiro says Kokoro and Mitsuru. Kokoro says that Hiro told them about it and it sounded wonderful. Mitsuru says they decided to do it before leaving. Goro, Miku, and Zorome voice their support. Though they stop to check on Futoshi, he exclaims that he wants to play the priest so he can be right beside Kokoro and Mitsuru to congratulate them. Kokoro thanks him.

MakingWeddingDress
Zero Two shows Kokoro a drawing of a wedding dress

Zero Two shows Kokoro a drawing of a wedding dress. Kokoro asks what material they can use to make it. Miku and Ichigo collect curtains to do so. Ichigo looks around the abandoned room that the couple slept in and notices a camera. Mitsuru and Goro make rings for the wedding and Mitsuru explains what they're for. When Goro says that Kokoro will love it, Mitsuru blushes and says he hopes so.

The parasites paint the side of the house. Ichigo brings Ikuno out and they all pose for a picture.

Zero Two looks at her mirror and headband. She is about to draw something but stops and looks at the drawings for her book. She hears screaming and a black hole appears in the ground. Countless stamens, such as 081, climb out of the hole and pull at her. The large hand is about to strike her, but she is woken up by Hiro.

Hiro asks if she's okay and she shakes in his chest. She smiles and says she dozed off. Hiro says her books almost complete, and she smiles and says she'll show it to him when she's done.

Zero Two and Hiro walk through the sakura. Zero Two wears a formal pistil outfit that Kokoro lent her and Hiro compliments her. She asks if he remembers their promise to marry and he says he does. They spin around in the petals.

As the others wait outside, Mitsuru paces at the bottom of the stairs. Kokoro comes down in her wedding dress. Mitsuru looks at her but becomes embarrassed and looks away. She takes his hand and says they'll find happiness together. Ikuno runs down the stairs and gives them each flowers and then opens the doors.

Zorome asks if they ring the bells now and Miku says yes. The parasites ring their bells as Mitsuru and Kokoro walk together as well as throwing petals. Futoshi cries.

Hachi watches the wedding from the control room but an APE assault ship appears. Alpha greets him from the monitor and Hachi asks who authorized them. Alpha answers that Papa did. Hachi asks if they are going to force them into the parasite camp's re-indoctrination program when Squad 13 is exempt from it. Alpha says just two of them. Alpha tells him to just sit there and watch, like usual.

Futoshi tells the couple to exchange rings. After they do, Futoshi tells them to kiss. Before they can, they are interrupted by APE SP who tell them to freeze. When Zorome questions them, he is hit with a gun. Futoshi stands in front of them and tells them to run. They do, but are stopped by the nines. Alpha tells them that Papa said they were dangerous and need to be re-indoctrinated.

Zero Two leaps forward to protect them. Alpha asks if she's still playing human and it’s getting embarrassing. She calls him the embarrassment and tries to attack him, but he jumps away. The other nines begin attacking her as well. They hold her down and Alpha tells her that she mustn't defy Papa. SP takes the couple and tear them from each other. Hachi comes down the steps and watches.

The parasites sit sadly around the yard. Hiro thinks that it's like the Garden and they're not allowed any happiness. As they pack, Hiro wonders where they were taken and if they'll come back. The cargo ship comes and picks them up.

At the Bird Nest, Ikuno says the parasites are being summoned in order. Miku says that it reminds her of Garden. The stamen talk about how it's been weeks since their last mission. Ichigo gets a message and they go to the door.

Kokoro and Mitsuru walk through. Though they still have their rings, they don't remember the wedding or each other. Zero Two tells Hiro that their memories have been altered, just like what happened to them. Hachi watches them as well.

Episode 19: Inhumanity
Hiro walks up and Ichigo asks about Zero Two. He says she just needs some final tune-ups. He tells the group that he's thinking of directly asking Papa to return them to normal.

Looking at his robotic hand, Hiro asks that Misturu and Kokoro's memories be returned. Papa refuses and says that they removed the unnecessary information and there is no way to return them. The rest of the parasites are distressed and the Vice Chairman says that what they're doing is a severe breach of protocol and would normally be punished, but they'll let it off with a mere mention on their record. He says to return to their waiting quarters. Futoshi demands that they apologize. Zorome asks how many klaxosaurs they have to kill before they can become adults. They don't answer and Zorome asks what they're living for. Hiro says that they took away Zero Two and his precious memories as well as Kokoro and Mitsuru's. He says they can't see him as their Papa and to set them free once the battle is over. Papa agrees, as long as they fulfill their duties in the next mission. Then they hang up. Dr. FRANXX tells them to show whether they can become real humans. Hiro says he saw him in Zero Two's memories and that he can't forgive him before walking out.

DARLINGWalk
Zero Two sits outside. He stares at her horns and she calls him a pervert. He smiles and tells her that they made their decision. He holds out his hand and they walk away. The doctor watches them walk away holding hands.

Episode 20: A New World
APEHiro
Hiro, Dr. FRANXX, and Zero Two meet with APE.

Gorilla says that they don't need to worry and Baboon says that that's why they modified it for so long. Another says that they're implanting Strelizia in Star Entity‘s core. Papa says to Zero Two that it is for that purpose that they raised her. She is unimpressed, but Hiro grabs her hand and asks what happens after that. He says that the future will belong to humanity if they defeat the klaxosaurs. He says they won't call him "Papa" anymore and they'll control their own destiny.

As squad 13 eats together, Futoshi tells Goro that both Kokoro and Mitsuru took off their rings. Goro is surprised he noticed and begins to ask if he's not over her, but stops and apologizes. Kokoro suddenly spills her water and runs to the bathroom to throw up.

On D-Day, at Bird Nest, Vice Chairman says that APE has always desired peace and prosperity for mankind. Marmoset tells them to offer all of themselves. Papa says they will finally prevail. 9'α watches the squad and becomes annoyed when he sees Zero Two yawn.

After the assembly, the 9's mock squad 13. Zero Two steps forward and says they're all stronger than them since they have their eyes on the future. This angers Alpha and he says that Papa only treats them differently because they're his tools before they all walk away. The squad is thankful to Zero Two but are interrupted by a siren.

An announcer says that a klaxosaur pack is headed towards Gran Crevasse. The parasites all head out. Kokoro rubs her finger and Mitsuru says they were partners, so they should be able to connect.

At the Gran Crevasse ruins, the FRANXX attack the klaxosaur. When Mitsuru compliments Kokoro, he has a pain in his head when saying her name. Genista struggles and Kokoro gets the same pain when saying "Mitsuru."

SnugglePromise
Zero Two and Hiro make a promise.

Hiro, Zero Two, Dr. FRANXX, and Hachi go down an elevator with Strelizia. Hiro and Zero Two discuss their plans and Zero Two says she doesn't care as long as they're together. She is about to say something about the last page of the book but stops herself. They kiss as they promise to be together forever.

They reach the bottom of Gran Crevasse. Zero Two hears something coming and they leave. One of the snake klaxosaur breaks through the wall and 001 says she won't allow them to do what they wish with their child. Dr. FRANXX asks if she's there to take back Star Entity, but he says she can't since she's the last surviving klaxo sapiens. He says he'll operate it with her since he always dreamed of it since they met. She suddenly pins him down and says she needs no partner, but she will use the one he's offered.

Strelizia tries to open a gate, but can't. 001 catches up and pulls Zero Two out, saying that she's a duplicate that does not realize she is being used by the invaders. She says she isn't fit to pilot their child before throwing her out. She kisses Hiro and says he must not be an ordinary human before closing the door. She says she will devour him and opens the door.

At Cosmos, Gorilla says that the worst has come to pass and the work on 002 will be in vain. Marmoset says that if she connects to Star Entity, they'll be defeated. The Vice Chairman says they've already taken measures.

Hachi and Dr. FRANXX see that she connected to Strelizia, and Dr. FRANXX falls into Hachi. He says he wasn't expecting her to link with a human and thinks she will devour once again.

Hiro asks how she can pilot Strelizia. She says it was originally one of their brethren. Her horns begin glowing and she sends a message to the pilots. Dr. FRANXX and Hachi hear as well. Dr. FRANXX says that he found that the klaxosaur split into two forms. One returned to the earth and became energy. Baboon says that the seal is an affront. Gorilla says that the magma energy is part of the planet's resources that saved humans from ruin. 001 says they're selfish and asks if they now want to steal her child. She says she will not allow it and that the child is a crystallization of their bonds.

Alpha tells her not to talk down to Papa. Dr. FRANXX finishes that the other form consumed that energy and evolved physically and stopped mingling with one another and lost their intelligence. Hachi asks what they are, and he says weapons built by the klaxo sapiens. They are composed of one male and one female klaxo sapiens. The female's soul connected to the weapon, and the male's soul took root in the core, the cockpit. Hachi says that it's similar to the FRANXX. Dr. FRANXX says they're an application of the klaxosaur system. Klaxosaurs that can be piloted by humans genetically modified to be similar. The parasites realize they'd been kept in the dark.

001 tells her child to awaken since they're nearly there. She begins the implanting process. Papa says that he was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but they have no choice. Vice Chairman says they wanted to take it and Hringhorni to space as soldiers. Papa says that, if they can't have it, then it can go down along with the planet and they will return to their original roles.

Klaxosaur begin popping out from the ground and shooting into space. They shoot spaceships in the sky. Star Entity wakes up and Dr. FRANXX says it's beautiful. 001 says that the humans made her ugly, but it's okay. She says a long time ago,when they were attacked by invaders from the expanse of space, they fought and drove them off and then holed up in the earth to prepare. They shoot at a VIRM fleet. They shoot back and 001 says that she won't let them touch their planet. It shoots back and destroys it. Papa says it's futile and she asks what VIRM did to their child. The chairman and vice chairman's masks fall and the vice -hairman says that Star Entity is a mass of life that could disturb the universe's peace. Papa says that if the klaxosaur princess took over the implanting process, they programmed it to explode. They say that the planet will explode and leave nothing behind. Papa says that they'll take them to eternal paradise.

02Blood
Zero Two continues on.

Zero Two continues to walk forward and says she'll keep her promise to Hiro.

Episode 21: For You, My Love
Vice Chairman announces that it is VIRM's will for Star Entity, which is a mass of life that could disturb the universe's peace. Papa says that if the klaxosaur princess took over the implanting process, they programmed it to explode. The other members of the council are confused and Papa explains that they have assimilated several lifeforms from all over the universe and helped them break free of the shells of their bodies. Vice Chairman says that the time has come for humans to embrace their evolution. They say that there exists a form of pleasure that is gentle and perpetual that they will experience. The three fall to the ground.

Hiro curses as 001 struggles. He connects to her consciousness. He asks if she's been alone since humanity existed. Zero Two walks along looking for Hiro. The other parasites watch as VIRM kills other parasites. They wonder who they should be fighting.

Dr. FRANXX says that the detonation stalled once Hiro connected, the explosion is triggered by stampede mode. Zero Two says that he bought them some time before collapsing.

The parasites wonder what they should do and worry about what the announcement said. They agree to return to Gran Crevasse to see for themselves.

001 says that VIRM got her and that it's no use. Hiro asks about VIRM and how long she'd been alive. 001 says that it has been more than sixty million years. They inhabited Earth as an advanced civilization. One day, VIRM arrived. They were a group mind with no physical bodies, and they wanted them to cast aside their bodies and join. During the war, they forged themselves into immortal weapons and evolved into Klaxosaurs. By the time they fought off VIRM, fighting and warfare were all that remained of their civilization and they lost their ability to procreate. The enemy they fought off was VIRM's vanguard. To prepare for their return, they went underground and the weak turned themselves into energy, and the strong combined to evolve into even stronger weapons.

Zero Two wakes up and says that 001 called her a fake. Dr. FRANXX says that 001 is the sole survivor of the klaxo sapiens, and she is her clone. She was created to operate Star Entity on behalf of the human race. He says that she was the only success. He created the 9's using her cells too, but they didn't inherit the Klaxosaur blood. She says that she's going to save Hiro and she doesn't care about the rest. Dr. FRANXX says he'll go as well.

As Squad 13 continues, they run into the 9's. They command them to return and continue to follow Papa's orders. They kill more klaxosaur, but are attacked and killed by VIRM.

The FRANXX break through and they go to help the two. Ikuno and Futoshi clear a path. Ikuno's turns grey. They let Zero Two go alone with Ichigo and Goro.

001 and Hiro continue to struggle. He relates to their want to fight but feels that he wasn't really living when he only wanted to fight.

02ForgivesDr
Hringhorni begins flying. Alpha asks Papa to say something. Dr. FRANXX and Zero Two continue as they stay to fight VIRM. Dr. FRANXX sacrifices his arm to the door, as it contains 001's cells. Though he wanted them to turn him into a klaxosaur. The snake allows zero Two to ride. She asks him if he took her to Plantation 13 to reunite her with Hiro. He says he wasn't expecting them to rekindle what they had and it was just a whim. Smiling, she thanks him for creating her and helping her meet Hiro. After she goes, he wonders how she became so human.

As they break through the wall, the snake klaxosaur dies. She opens the door to Strelizia and tries to revive Hiro. She finds out that he's covered in blood and that they'd run out of time. Her horns break free and her skin turns red and she kisses him. 001 gives the rest of her strength to them. She stakes the planet on them.

The two reunite under a tree after keeping their promise. They kiss and the bomb disintegrates. It breaks their program and begins attacking VIRM. Dr. FRANXX finds her beautiful before a rock kills him. VIRM takes their lance and withdraws saying that they will bring back their army.

Panting, Hiro smiles and says to Zero Two that they did it. She doesn't respond, and her face is lifeless as her horn crumbles.

Episode 22: Stargazers
Hiro takes care of Zero Two while she is in a catatonic state and is confused when mysterious injuries begin showing up on her body. Hiro finds the last page of her story blank and he realizes she deliberately left it blank because she foresaw they would part ways one day. She starts wondering around from her room and goes outside, looking at the sky. Hiro vows to be with her and, when his horns make contact with her, he realizes her mind is with Strelizia and she is actually fighting VIRM in Mars’ orbit system in space.

Hiro decides to go to the battlefield and save Zero Two even though Squad 13, specifically Goro, tell him he will die. Hiro says if Zero Two can’t smile at him, he would rather be dead. Before leaving, Hiro cuddles with Zero Two as they sleep side by side.

Episode 23: DARLING in the FRANXX
Zero Two stands outside and looking up at the sky while Kokoro and Mitsuru watch her. She starts walking aimlessly and trying to reach for the sky when new injuries begin appearing on her body. Kokoro becomes alarmed and makes it her responsibility to protect her. Even when a heavy thunderstorm rolls by, Kokoro refuses to leave Zero Two’s side. Concerned for Kokoro’s safety, as she is pregnant, Mitsuru decides to stay with them both.

In space, Hiro is able to connect with Zero Two’s consciousness and finds that her mind is filled with pages from her story. Hiro recalls his promise to be with her forever and wants her to devour him. Zero Two says they can’t be together because he needs to be human.

Zero Two says she is fine being alone but Hiro approaches her and offers his hand to her. She takes his hand and they embrace, with him vowing to be with her always. On Earth, her body turns into a statue, whereas in space, Zero Two‘s mind via Strelizia evolves into Strelizia True Apus and she annihilates a horde of VIRM fleets. Then, a Warp Gate opens. She explains to Squad 13 that the klaxo sapiens built the satellites to open it a long time ago. She and Hiro decide to enter it together because only they can go through. Squad 13 protests this and Zero Two explains they decided this in order to end the war. When asked if they will return, neither give an answer. Nevertheless, everyone says they believe Hiro and Zero Two will come back because their squad isn’t the same without them and they will all build a home together, moving Zero Two to tears. She and Hiro take a Klaxosaur Bomb and then enter the warp gate.

Episode 24: Never Let Me Go
After 70 days of traveling, Hiro notes he hasn’t had the need to eat or sleep and wonders if he is becoming a full klaxosaur. Zero Two asks if he is afraid but he says no because he feels like he is becoming part of her. They come across a swarm of VIRM and proceed to wipe them out. Hiro says he doesn’t recognize the stars because they are so far away from Earth. Zero Two suggests they create their own constellation before they encounter more VIRM and destroy them.

783 days since the gate passage, Hiro falls asleep and Zero Two notes that it is unusual and worries he is getting weak from pushing himself. He says he had a dream in which their friends were living good lives and another dream in which the two of them meet in a distant future but he believes it is hope for them. Zero Two replies, no matter what destiny they face, they will be together forever. They finally reach the VIRM home planet and are confronted by Papa and the Vice Chairman. VIRM soldiers attack them and Hiro is knocked out and loses his connection with Zero Two, who is impaled by Hringhorni. Papa and the Vice Chairman says this is due to the pair’s incompatibility of Hiro being human and Zero Two a klaxosaur. Zero Two calls out for her friends to save Hiro. Squad 13 surmises Zero Two’s body can serve as a link to her and Hiro in space. They hold hands and send their thoughts to them, which gradually reaches them. Hiro regains consciousness when he hears Mitsuru and Kokoro say they had a daughter and named her Ai because it means ‘love ’, a word they were never taught but learned from Hiro and Zero Two. She credits Hiro for starting the series of events that made everyone’s lives like this. Hiro says it’s not something to be proud of because all he did was cause trouble to them. Zero Two replies it was because of his will to live and encourages him to join her so they rewrite the story. They kiss and reconnect. Reverting back to the Strelizia Iron Maiden form, Hiro and Zero Two take control of Hringhorni and destroy the fleets before they force the klaxosaur bomb into the planet and thrust Strelizia into the bomb to detonate it. Knowing they will vanish when it detonates, they profess their love to each other. The bomb explodes and all the souls kept in the planet are liberated, though Papa and the Vice Chairman survive and vow to return at the peak of evolution.

On Earth, everyone sees the blast and realizes Hiro and Zero Two won but sacrificed themselves, which saddens them. Zero Two’s body then cracks into dust and a single plant is left. Over the next eight years, the memory of Hiro and Zero Two remains on the minds of their friends. Ichigo finishes Zero Two’s story book and all the children are taught to read it in their memory. Squad 13 reunites at a cherry tree that grew from Zero Two’s ashes and they thank Hiro and Zero Two for the lessons they learned from the two and for giving them a chance to live normal lives.
